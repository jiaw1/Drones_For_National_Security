Drones For National Security

Because of the turmoil in the global geopolitics, new ways to monitor and protect crucial infrastructure is becoming an important issue. We have seen the rise of drones in the Russian war on Ukraine and importance of them. In Finland we have also felt the threat of sabotage and hybrid influence. 6G technologies offer completely new tools to manage and control vast fleets of drones with unparallel accuracy.

If we assume costs and technology are not the issues, how might we utilize vast drone fleets to monitor and secure the critical infrastructure in Finland? May it be nuclear power plants, water treatment facilities or power grid, the sheer scale of this infrastructure makes it almost impossible to do without the smart use of technology.

In this project we want to focus first on smaller context and scale the solutions up to national, and even EU level. How might a massive fleet of drones operating autonomously be visualized, controlled, and ultimately execute their missions in the varied and harsh conditions we live in? If we would have such fleets at our disposal, what other value could we create with them while they are patrolling?

Join the project if you are interested in drones, future tech or usability of massive systems!
