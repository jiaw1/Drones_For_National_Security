            <h2>Autonomous Drone Fleets: the Future of Aerial Defense and National Security?</h2>
            <p>Unauthorized drones are spotted daily near critical infrastructure in Finland. Their purpose varies from thoughtless curiosity to serious threats of scouting weak points or even attempts of sabotage. In the project we created ways to counter these unwanted drones with a fleet of security drones. </p>
            <p>Some of the critical infrastructure sites are owned by government agencies but mostly by private utilities who have legal obligations to secure them to a certain level. The end-user in the scenario is a security director who decides the methods how the site is protected. The solution can also be outsourced from a security agency.</p>
            <p>The drone fleet operation will benefit from the upcoming 6G mobile network technology. It enables high-speed and low-latency communication, but for drone communication especially the enhanced privacy and security will provide better resilience towards interference. The most interesting feature in 6G will be the spatial monitoring which improves the accurate positioning of drones within the fleet as well as the detection of the surroundings and other objects.</p>

            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>There is increasing demand for autonomous surveillance solutions due to geopolitical threats, hybrid warfare and protection of key infrastructures such as nuclear plants, water treatment facilities, the power grid, and military sites.</p>
            <p>Government agencies require comprehensive, real-time monitoring of sensitive areas. Utility providers are concerned with securing infrastructure from potential sabotage.</p>
            <p>Our solution is a drone fleet that monitors and protects a critical infrastructure facility against unauthorized drones. The fleet consists of several types of drones, which have surveillance and counter-drone capabilities. Drones share information with each other and other security systems.</p>
            <p>The fleet operates mostly autonomously based on artificial intelligence and machine learning models, but it can be monitored and controlled by a fleet operator in a single software. The secured site is equipped with infrastructure supporting the fleet such as nests for battery reload, beacons for alternative positioning system and a 6G communication network.</p>
            <p>The solution provides a tool against modern drone threats. It can identify threats and protect the facility autonomously in real-time with an operating system which can be used from a control room. </p>
