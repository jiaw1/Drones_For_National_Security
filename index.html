            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>Unauthorized drones are spotted daily near critical infrastructure in Finland. Their purpose varies from thoughtless curiosity to serious threats of scouting weak points or even attempts of sabotage. In the project we created ways to counter these unwanted drones with a fleet of security drones. </p>
            <p>Some of the critical infrastructure sites are owned by government agencies but mostly by private utilities who have legal obligations to secure them to a certain level. The end-user in the scenario is a security director who decides the methods how the site is protected. The solution can also be outsourced from a security agency.</p>
            <p>The drone fleet operation will benefit from the upcoming 6G mobile network technology. It enables high-speed and low-latency communication, but for drone communication especially the enhanced privacy and security will provide better resilience towards interference. The most interesting feature in 6G will be the spatial monitoring which improves the accurate positioning of drones within the fleet as well as the detection of the surroundings and other objects.</p>
